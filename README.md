# content_aggregator_backend
This is a backend of a content aggregator, backiend and integration with database were my primary objectives here(hence the frontnd experiance may be somewhat lackluster, it uses only jinja2 and one line of css).

In this project my stack was Flask+MongoDB+jinja2.

If you want to play with it yourself just replace the string in line 28 with connection string you got from mongo, and save password to your client in base.cfg file(and have it reside in the same directory as your app.py).
Furthermore store your secret in secret.cfg file just like your password.

Any advice or comments appreciated!
